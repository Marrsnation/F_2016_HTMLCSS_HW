# Rebuild Instagram
Your task is to rebuild the instagram landing page.

##Objective
I can use background images and position elements to create a layout.


Instagram's designer sent over the following screen shot of the design. Your job is the create the markup and the styling for the landing page. All the resources that you need are in a folder called 'images'.

For now, don't worry about about making the links work. You can just put in a place holder link, ex `<a href="#">A link to no where</a>`

There are some html elements we haven't used yet. Use `<input type="text">` for the username and password feels. Use `<button>` for the button. You will have to style both these elements to make them look right.


For the font try using "Helvetica Neue", its not a perfect match but its close.


It can be really hard to a page pixel perfect to the mock-up. Do your best but don't pull out your hair over small differences. Have fun!
