## Barnard Times!
Your going to create a simple Barnard News site! Follow the instructions below. Feel free to be creative!

### HTML
- inside the `<body>`, create a `<h1>` with some title. 
- You are going to create three posts, so create a three `<div>` tags. Make sure you close each with `</div>`
- Give each div a class of "post"
- inside each div 
  + add an `<h2>` with a title for the post
  + add a picture using the `<img>` tag 
  + paragraph `<p>` with some text.
- Create a `<div>` with a class of 'footer', inside the footer create a paragraph with some basic info about your sweet newspaper.

### CSS
- Target the `body` tag, create a rule to change the background color
- Target the `img` tags, create a rule to make every image have a height of 400 pixels
- Target the `post` class, change the text color, font size, add some margin
- Target only the `h2` tags that are inside the `post` class, give them a font color different from the paragraphs
- Target the paragraph inside the `footer` class, give it a different font size and color then the other paragraphs
- Create a rule for an id of `featured`, write a rule that makes the h2 inside featured be a bright color! Go back to HTML and make one of your posts featured. All other h2s should stay the same. 
- BONUS, use CSS to make the post images circles.
- BONUS, add image as a logo in front of the title, this image should be a square.
- BONUS, change the font.
